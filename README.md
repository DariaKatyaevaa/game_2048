# 2048

A clone of 2048 Game. Made with Flutter.

2048 is a number puzzle game. When the squares of the same number are merged together, they will add
up. Each round will have an extra square with 2 or 4 written on it, and the game ends when the
square cannot be moved. Players have to find a way to make up a square with 2048 (or larger).
